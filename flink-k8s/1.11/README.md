# Fast Data: Financial Transaction Processing with Apache Flink and Kubernetes

During this demo we use Apache Flink and Apache Kafka to setup a high-volume financial transactions pipeline.
Note, this is a derivate of the [Apache Flink Stream Processing](flink/1.11#fast-data-financial-transaction-processing-with-apache-flink) demo, where we use Kubernetes to deploy the generator and viewer microservices.

- Estimated time for completion:
 - Manual install: 15min
- Target audience: Anyone interested in stream data processing and analytics with Apache Kafka and Apache Flink.

## Architecture

![Financial transaction processing demo architecture](img/kafka-flink-arch.png)

This demo implements a data processing infrastructure that is able to spot money laundering. In the context of money laundering, we  want to detect amounts larger than $10.000 transferred between two accounts, even if that amount is split into many small batches.  See also [US](https://www.fincen.gov/history-anti-money-laundering-laws) and [EU](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015L0849) legislation and regulations on this topic for more information.

The architecture follows more or less the [SMACK stack architecture](https://mesosphere.com/blog/smack-stack-new-lamp-stack/):
- Events: Event are being generated by a small [GOLANG generator](https://github.com/dcos/demos/blob/master/flink/1.11/generator/generator.go). The events are in the form 'Sunday, 23-Jul-17 01:06:47 UTC;66;26;7810', where the first field '23-Jul-17 01:06:47 UTC' represents the (increasing) timestamp of transactions; the second field '66' represent the sender account; the third field the receiver account; and the fourth field represent the dollar amount transferred during that transaction.
- Ingestion: The generated events are being ingested and buffered by a Kafka queue with the default topic 'transactions'. Being a Microservice we will deploy the data-generator on kubernetes.
- Stream Processing: As we require fast response times, we use Apache Flink as a Stream processor running the [FinancialTransactionJob](https://github.com/dcos/demos/tree/master/flink/1.10/flink-job/src/main/java/io/dcos).
- Storage: Here we diverge a bit from the typical SMACK stack setup and don't write the results into a Datastore such as Apache Cassandra. Instead we write the results again into a Kafka Stream (default: 'fraud'). Note, that Kafka also offers data persistence for all unprocessed events.
- Actor: In order to view the results we use again a small [Golang viewer](https://github.com/dcos/demos/blob/master/flink/1.11/actor/actor_viewer.go) which simply reads and displays the results from the output Kafka stream. Being a Microservice we will deploy the viewer on kubernetes.


## Prerequisites

- A running [DC/OS 1.11](https://dcos.io/releases/) or higher cluster with at least 4 private agents and 1 public agent. Each agent should have 2 CPUs and 5 GB of RAM available. The [DC/OS CLI](https://docs.mesosphere.com/latest/cli/install/) also needs to be installed.


The DC/OS services used in the demo are as follows:

- Apache Kafka
- Apache Flink
- Kubernetes

## Install


#### Kafka

Install the Apache Kafka package :

```bash
$ dcos package install kafka
```

Note that if you are unfamiliar with Kafka and its terminology, you can check out the respective [101 example](https://github.com/dcos/examples/tree/master/kafka).

Next, figure out where the broker is:

```bash
$ dcos kafka endpoints broker
{
  "address": [
    "10.0.2.64:1025",
    "10.0.2.83:1025",
    "10.0.0.161:1025"
  ],
  "dns": [
    "kafka-0-broker.kafka.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory:1025",
    "kafka-1-broker.kafka.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory:1025",
    "kafka-2-broker.kafka.autoip.dcos.thisdcos.directory:1025"
  ],
  "vip": "broker.kafka.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:9092"
}
```

Note the FQDN for the vip, in our case `broker.kafka.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:9092`, which is independent of the actual broker locations.
It is possible to use the FQDN of any of the brokers, but using the VIP FQDN will give us load balancing.

##### Create Kafka Topics

Fortunately, creating topic is very simple using the DC/OS Kafka CLI. If you have installed Kafka from the UI you might have to
install the cli extensions using `dcos package install kafka --cli'. If you installed Kafka as above using the CLI then it will automatically install the CLI extensions.

We need two Kafka topics, one with the generated transactions and one for fraudulent transactions, which we can create with:

`dcos kafka topic create transactions`
and
`dcos kafka topic create fraud`



### Flink

Finally, we can deploy [Apache Flink](https://github.com/dcos/examples/tree/master/flink/) :

```bash
$ dcos package install flink
```

At this point we have all of the required elements installed - Kafka, Flink and the data generator. We are now ready to start the demo.

### Kubernetes

As we want to deploy both the generator and viewer microservice on Kubernetes, we need to install kubernetes next.
This can be done by a simple

```bash
$ dcos package install kubernetes
```

Once kubernetes is successfully deployed, we need to configure 'kubectl' (kubernetes command line tool). Check the [documentation](https://docs.mesosphere.com/services/kubernetes/1.0.2-1.9.6/connecting-clients/) for details.

We now need to create our Kubernetes context, which will allow Kubectl to send commands to corect cluster.

```bash
$ dcos kubernetes kubeconfig
```

### Generator

Now, we can deploy the [data generator](https://github.com/dcos/demos/blob/master/flink/1.11/generator/generator.go) using the [flink-demo-generator.yaml deployment definition](https://github.com/dcos/demos/blob/master/flink-k8s/1.11/generator/flink-demo-generator.yaml):

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcos/demos/master/flink-k8s/1.11/generator/flink-demo-generator.yaml
```

We can check the status of the deployment:

```bash
$ kubectl get deployments
$ kubectl get pods
```

We can also view the log output to make sure it is generating events as expected (you will need to use the actual pod id from the previous command):

```bash
$ kubectl logs flink-demo-generator-655890656-8d1ls
```


### Final View

After install your DC/OS UI should look as follows:

![All services of the fintrans demo in the DC/OS UI](img/services-list.png)

## Use


The core piece of this demo is the [FinancialTransactionJob](https://github.com/dcos/demos/tree/master/flink/1.11/flink-job/src/main/java/io/dcos) which we will submit to Flink.

First we need to upload the [jar file](https://downloads.mesosphere.com/dcos-demo/flink/flink-job-1.0.jar) into Flink. Please note that the jar file is too large to be included in this github repo, but can be downloaded [here](https://downloads.mesosphere.com/dcos-demo/flink/flink-job-1.0.jar).

In the Services tab of the DCOS UI, hover over the name of the flink service, and click on the link which appears to the right of it. This will open the Flink web UI in a new tab.

![Flink UI](img/flink-gui.png)

In the Flink web UI, click on Submit New Job, then click the Add New button. This will allow you to select the jar file from $DEMO_HOME and upload it.


![Jar file uploaded](img/jar-uploaded.png)


Once we hit Submit, we should see the job begin to run in the Flink web UI.

### Viewing Output

Now once the Flink job is running, we only need a way to visualize the results. We do that with another [simple GoLang app](https://github.com/dcos/demos/blob/master/flink/1.11/actor/actor_viewer.go) and again we will deploy this microservice using kubernetes using the [flink-demo-actor.yaml deployment definition](https://github.com/dcos/demos/blob/master/flink-k8s/1.11/actor/flink-demo-actor.yaml):
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcos/demos/master/flink-k8s/1.11/actor/flink-demo-actor.yaml
```
We can check the status of the deployment:

```bash
$ kubectl get deployments
$ kubectl get pods
```

We can also view the log output to make we are detecting fraud as expected (you will need to use the actual pod id from the previous command):

```bash
$ kubectl logs flink-demo-actor--655890656-8d1ls
Detected Fraud:   TransactionAggregate {startTimestamp=0, endTimestamp=1520473325000, totalAmount=23597:

Transaction{timestamp=1520473004000, origin=2, target='3', amount=5027}
Transaction{timestamp=1520473050000, origin=2, target='3', amount=924}
Transaction{timestamp=1520473177000, origin=2, target='3', amount=1566}
Transaction{timestamp=1520473412000, origin=2, target='3', amount=5272}}
```

### Helm

You can also install `Generator` and `Viewer` with the Helm.

#### Install Helm

Get the latest [Helm release](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm#install).

#### Add remote Helm repo

You need to add this Chart repo:
